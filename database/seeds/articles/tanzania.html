    <p>This summer, I had the unforgettable opportunity to study abroad in Tanzania in a small village called Rhotia for
        wildlife conservation policy and research techniques. While I went for the prospect of learning more about the
        environmental field that I plan on entering in the future, the experience and knowledge I gained from the local
        communities and people far surpassed anything I could have hoped for. Our study abroad center was located between
        the towns of Karatu and Mto Wa Mbu, within the Tarangire-Manyara Ecosystem. The Tanzanian way of life largely
        depends on agriculture and pastoralism, so they are heavily connected to the natural resources and native animal
        species. I was able to directly observe this by spending a day on a home-stay with a local family and by visiting
        some of the 120 tribes found in Tanzania. We also conducted research in three of the national parks that the
        country has to offer.</p>
    <p>During my home-stay I was with a family of four children and a mother living in a small mudhouse. Traditionally the
        father is away for the day doing work, and the mother stays at home to take care of the children and cook and
        clean. The home had a small shack outside where four pigs were kept, and there were some small plots of crops
        like corn and pumpkins. I helped to collect and chop pumpkins to feed to the pigs, and made mud with the children
        to throw at the house. They live directly within the environment and need a healthy Earth in order to live. Another
        example of this reliance on natural resources was with the Maasai tribe, a group of people who establish temporary
        homes made of cow manure and branches within a boma, an area fenced in by branches. They have a pastoralist way
        of life, so they rely on their cattle, sheeps and goats for their livelihood. They struggle with local wildlife,
        particularly lions, killing the cattle, and it’s customary for the men of the tribe to go out in search of local
        lion prides to kill them in retaliation. The government tries to control this, but it can be difficult because
        of the remoteness of the tribe and the long tradition of retaliatory killings.</p>

    <p>The Maasai aren’t the only people in Tanzania who struggle with wildlife conflicts. Elephants can trample crops,
        and because of their size they can get through fencing that tries to keep the animals out. Hyenas are active
        at night and can pose threats to people; in fact, here was a case of a drunk man being eaten by a hyena a few
        weeks before my study abroad program began. Still, the country’s government prioritizes conservation as a sense
        of national pride, and because of the revenue it provides through photographic tourism and tourist hunting. Initiatives
        have been taken to involve communities more heavily in conservation, allowing them to establish their land as
        Wildlife Management Areas that protect the animal species and give the local people some income. Conservation
        areas are beautiful parts of Tanzania that are protected to various degrees with the purpose of protecting animal
        species and benefitting the government or communities in some way. We spent a lot of time in national parks,
        for instance, which are a huge draw for international tourists to come for safaris. The national parks completely
        restrict any human activity besides this tourism and any approved research projects. One of the projects we got
        to conduct was an animal count, which involved counting individual animals of each mammal species that we came
        across for the purpose of determining animal densities. It was exhilarating when we saw African wild dogs, a
        species that was once locally extinct in the area.</p>

    <p>My time in Tanzania is unlikely to be outdone by many other experiences in my future. It was beneficial for me as
        I learned tools for a career, but I also learned about myself from the people and ways of life I was exposed
        to. I created beautiful memories of watching lion prides walk across a savannah, helping my home-stay family
        make ugali and cabbage over a stove made of mud, and collecting firewood with the Maasai tribe. It solidified
        for me that this planet we live on deserves love, protection, and prioritization.</p>
